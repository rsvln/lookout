# Lookout

A companion service for [Frigate NVR](https://frigate.video). Frigate's own clips can be cut short or out of sync when a stream lags; Lookout waits until the recording of an event or review is really complete ("true end"), builds the clip from the recording segments itself and delivers it to Telegram together with snapshots, an AI description and recognized faces. A web UI on top of Frigate's database shows what happened: live log, event galleries with video, statistics and the config editor.

Previously named **frte2tg**.

## Features

**Telegram delivery**
- Handles both Frigate **events** and **reviews** (configurable per camera): objects with confidence thresholds, zones, severity, triggers
- Waits until all recording segments are on disk, then sends **complete video clips** built with ffmpeg; large clips are split automatically
- **Snapshots** as media groups; for objects still in view (e.g. a parked car in a review that has already ended) the current best frame comes from the Frigate API
- **Animated GIF previews** (optional, per camera)
- Telegram rate limit handling with automatic retry; local Bot API server supported for large files

**Recognition and AI**
- **AI snapshot descriptions** via Ollama with a vision model (optional, per camera), in the language you choose
- **Face recognition** via CompreFace (optional, per camera); recognized names are passed to the AI as context

**Telegram commands**
- `/status` — current frame of every camera
- `/last` — latest events of every camera or one camera, with buttons to switch camera and object
- `/stat` — events by camera, object, hour and day for 24 h / today / 7 d / 30 d, with buttons to switch the period

**Web UI** (port 8888)
- Live log with filters, newest lines first
- **Last events** as snapshot cards with in-page **video playback and download** (clips built from recordings, also for events still in progress)
- **Statistics**: cameras × objects matrix, activity by hour and day; click any cell or bar to see the events behind it as a gallery
- Every view has its own address, so it can be bookmarked or shared; browser Back / Forward work
- YAML **config editor** with highlighting and validation, applied without restarting the container
- Optional password

**Integration**
- Re-publishes an event / review to MQTT with type `trueend` once its recording is complete, for automations (optional, per camera)
- **Localization**: web UI, Telegram and AI languages set separately (`en`, `ru`, easy to add more)
- Runs as a Docker container (Docker Hub and GitHub Container Registry)

## Requirements

- [Frigate NVR](https://frigate.video) with MQTT enabled
- MQTT broker
- Telegram bot token + local Bot API server (optional but recommended for large files)
- ffmpeg available in container (used for clips, GIFs and resizing snapshots for AI)
- Frigate HTTP API reachable at `frigate.host:frigate.port` (for snapshots of in-progress events and clips in the web UI)
- Ollama instance with a vision model (optional, for AI descriptions)
- [CompreFace](https://github.com/exadel-inc/CompreFace) instance (optional, for face recognition)

### Camera options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `snapshot` | bool | `true` | Send snapshots |
| `clip` | bool | `false` | Send video clips |
| `gif` | bool | `false` | Send animated GIF preview generated from the clip |
| `ai` | bool | `false` | Enable AI snapshot analysis for this camera (requires `ai` section) |
| `fr` | bool | `false` | Enable face recognition for this camera (requires `fr` section) |
| `trueend` | bool | `false` | Re-publish event/review to the same MQTT topic with `type: trueend` once all recordings are confirmed ready in Frigate DB. Useful for triggering downstream automations only when the clip is complete. |
| `sctogether` | bool | `false` | Send snapshot and clip in one media group |
| `snapshottrigger` | string | `end` | When to send snapshot: `new`, `update`, or `end` |
| `topic` | string | `reviews` | Which MQTT topic to use: `reviews` or `events` |
| `severity` | list | `[detection, alert]` | Frigate review severity filter |
| `objects` | list | `[]` | Filter by object label and minimum confidence `percent` (the event's best score; for reviews, the best score of its detections) |
| `zones` | list | `[]` | Filter by Frigate zone names (empty = all zones) |

## GIF Previews

When `gif: true` is set for a camera, Lookout generates an animated GIF from the recorded clip using ffmpeg (8 fps, 8x speed) and sends it as a separate Telegram animation. Width is controlled globally via `options.gifwidth`.

## Face Recognition

When the `fr` section is present and `url`/`apikey` are set, enabling `fr: true` on a camera will run face recognition on snapshots via [CompreFace](https://github.com/exadel-inc/CompreFace) before posting results to Telegram.

If `ai: true` is also enabled on the camera, recognized names are automatically passed to Ollama as context, enriching the description prompt. If only `fr` is enabled without `ai`, the caption is updated with recognized names directly.

To set up CompreFace, use the provided `docker-compose-compreface.yml`, then open the web UI, create an application, add a Recognition Service, and upload face photos for each person via the Train section.

## AI Analysis

When the `ai` section is present and `url`/`model` are set, enabling `ai: true` on a camera will:

1. Send all snapshots to Ollama after posting to Telegram
2. Edit the Telegram message caption with AI descriptions for each snapshot

Uses the `humanprompt` if Frigate detected a person, `nonhumanprompt` otherwise. Without them, the default prompts of the `locale.ai` language are used. When `options.locale.ai` is set, every prompt ends with "answer in <that language>", so descriptions come in that language whatever language the prompt is written in; without it the prompts are sent as written. If face recognition is also enabled, recognized names are prepended to the prompt automatically.

Snapshots wider than `resizetowidth` are downscaled with ffmpeg before being sent to Ollama.

Tested with `qwen2.5vl:7b` on a machine with RTX 3060 — ~2 seconds per image.

## Web UI

Available at `http://<host>:8888`. The Config tab shows the bot token and MQTT password, so set `web.user` / `web.password` if the port is reachable by others.

- **Log** — live log viewer with filtering by type, camera, text, color-coded by event ID
- **Last** — latest N events of every camera (grouped by camera) or the history of one camera, as snapshot cards with object, score, time and zones. Click a snapshot to enlarge it. Every card has **▶ Video** (plays the clip in the page, with seeking) and **⬇** (downloads it); the clip is built from the camera's recording segments, so it works even when Frigate has no clip of its own, and for an event still in progress it covers the recording up to now. In-progress events show the current frame from Frigate
- **Stats** — events / alerts / detections for a period (24 h, today, 7 d, 30 d), cameras × objects matrix, activity by hour of day and by day. The object filter defaults to **Config** — only cameras and objects (with their `percent` thresholds) the bot is configured to send; **All** shows everything Frigate saw. Click a matrix cell to drill down; **← Back** returns to the previous view or to the overview
- **Config** — YAML editor with syntax highlighting, error underlining, line numbers, folding and search (Ctrl+F); Tab and pasted tabs become spaces. **Save** writes the file (with a `.bak` backup), **Apply** restarts the services with the saved file, **Save & apply** does both. A config with YAML errors or missing sections is not saved
- **About** — version, build date, links and this manual with highlighted code

Every view has its own address, with the filters in it, so it can be bookmarked or shared and the browser's Back / Forward work: `/log?camera=homecam02&type=review`, `/last?camera=homecam01&label=car`, `/stats?period=7d&label=person`, `/stats/events?period=24h&camera=homecam01&hour=8` (the events behind a stats cell or chart bar), `/event/<id>` (one event; the time on every card links to it), `/config`, `/about`. Opening `/` shows the view seen last. The version and build date are shown in the footer of every page.

## Localization

Telegram messages, bot commands, the web UI and AI descriptions are translated. `options.locale` sets the language: one value for all of them (`locale: ru`), or `web`, `telegram` and `ai` under it for each separately, e.g. the web UI in English with Telegram and AI in Russian. Default is `en`, also for an area left out.

Strings live in `locales/<locale>.json` next to the app (`/app/locales` in the container), one flat `"key": "text"` file per language; `en.json` and `ru.json` are included. To add a language, copy `en.json` to e.g. `de.json`, translate the values and set `locale: de` (or `de` for one area). Keys missing in a translation fall back to English.

Object names from every locale file are understood in commands, e.g. `/last человек` works with any `locale`.

## Telegram commands

Commands are accepted only from chats listed in `telegram.chatids`. Data for `/last` and `/stat` is read from the Frigate database (`frigate.dbpath`) and snapshots from `frigate.clipspath`.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/status` | Current frame from every camera |
| `/last` | Latest event of every camera, plus buttons to pick a camera, an object or N per camera |
| `/last [N] [object]` | Last N events of every camera (default 1), e.g. `/last 3`, `/last 2 person` |
| `/last <camera> [N] [object]` | Last N events of one camera (default 5), e.g. `/last frontdoor 10`, `/last frontdoor dog` |
| `/stat [period] [camera or object]` | Event statistics by object, camera and hour of day, with buttons to switch the period; period is `24h` (default), `7d`, `30d` or `today` |
| `/help` | Help |

Objects can be given by their Frigate label (`person`) or by their name in any locale file (`человек`).
